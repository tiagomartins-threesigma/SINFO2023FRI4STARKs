# SINFO 2023 FRI 4 STARKs
For the SINFO Workshop on the 28th of February of 2023 at 17:30 GMT (duration 90 minutes).

Unlock the secrets of the cutting-edge world of cryptography at our "FRI for ZK-STARKs" workshop! Join us for an immersive and hands-on journey into the world of zero-knowledge succinct transparent argument of knowledge (ZK-STARK) and the FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) based FRI (Fast Reed-Solomon Interactive Oracle Proofs of Proximity).
Explore the exciting potential of ZK-STARKs, a new area of cryptography that enables efficient, transparent, and post-quantum secure proof systems. Get a comprehensive introduction to the underlying mathematical concepts and see how they apply to the world of blockchains.
Discover the revolutionary potential of the FRI method, which has been called a breakthrough for allowing the construction of ZK-STARKs with much shorter proof sizes. Get a hands-on experience in implementing the FRI method, including its optimization techniques.
This workshop is perfect for developers, researchers, and cryptography enthusiasts looking to expand their knowledge in the field. With a mix of theoretical presentations, practical demonstrations, and hands-on exercises, you'll be able to dive deep into the world of ZK-STARKs and FRI.
Remember to bring your laptop with:
- Python installed (preferably version 3.10)
And the essential libraries pre-installed to fully participate in the hands-on portion of the workshop:
- numpy
- galois
With everyone ready to go, we can ensure a seamless and productive learning experience for all attendees. Don't miss this opportunity, join us now!
